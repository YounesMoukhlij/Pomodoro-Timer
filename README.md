# Pomodoro-Timer
The goal of this project is to learn and practice frontend development skills by building a Pomodoro Timer, a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks.
